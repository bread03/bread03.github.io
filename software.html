            <h2>Song Showdown for Spotify</h2>
            <p>
                Using the spotify API for web and android, I created an android app that allows a user to 
                log in using their spotify account, search public playlists (including their own) and use those 
                to play a knockout styled tournament between songs to find out which song is the best. It provides 
                previews of songs to compare and full songs (when previews aren't available) if the user has Spotify Premium, 
                it also allows users to like songs which will be added to their Spotify liked songs or access the song page on 
                Spotify. This project came about when my friends and I would compare songs in a similar fashion using an outdated 
                website.

            <h2>Personal Portfolio Website (obviously...)</h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to continue my learning and improvement in web development using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, so I 
                decided to create my own personal portfolio website using GitHub Pages. This also allowed me to strengthen 
                my knowledge and skills using GitHub as well. This became a very fun project and hope to continously add and 
                improve the website.

            <h2>Arduino Traffic System</h2>
            <p>
                In a team of four, we were tasked with creating a simplified version of a traffic system 
                using LEDs, and appropriate sensors to detect pedestrians and cars, as well as implementing 
                a day and night cyle for traffic lights. Security features such as a login system with lock-out 
                were implemented with Python along with the traffic system integration with Arduino. A heartbeat 
                signal was also implemented to make the system restart after 'power' is cut off for a specified 
                amount of time. The implemented software can be interacted with to monitor the system and make changes 
                to light timing as well.
